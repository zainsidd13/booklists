# BookLists - Start Here!

BookLists | CRUD App (In Development)

BookLists is a web application developed using **React + Vite**, **Node.js** with **Express.js**, and a **MySQL** database. It allows users to create and discover book lists across different genres. The project showcases my proficiency in modern web development technologies and demonstrates my ability to build scalable applications.

**Key Technologies:**
* **React + Vite**: Leveraged the power of React and Vite to create a responsive user interface.
* **Node.js + Express.js**: Built a robust backend API for seamless communication between the frontend and backend.
* **MySQL**: Ensured secure and efficient storage of book data.
* **MaterialUI**: Enhanced the visual appeal and usability of the application.
* **Google Books API**: Integrated to fetch comprehensive book information, expanding the range of available books.
* **Axios**: Handled HTTP requests for smooth communication between the frontend and backend.
* **React Router Dom**: Enabled smooth navigation within the application.
* **Bootstrap**: Improved responsiveness and device compatibility.

I am currently working on adding user authentication and polishing the frontend design. Once completed, the application will be deployed to Google's Firebase cloud server for scalability.

Until then, below are a few images of the websites current status:

This is the page on which a list is created by users. They may choose a name, choose the genre sections to which it will be published in, give it a description, and then finally add books.

The search bar (custom made by me) utilizes google books API to search for books to be added. Upon hovering over each book, the user has the option to move up, down, or delete the book entirely. Once completed, the user can then publish the book for other users to see!

This is the fantasy page to which the list was published. As you can see, the frontend still needs to be polished. There are other test lists (that can currently only be deleted from the MySQL Database) as well as the list we just made. Clicking the "Go Somehwere" button (which will be changed) takes you to the respective list. I am still developing the frontend for the list page but a new page is indeed created along with each list. I have access to the lists description, genre, id, and books thanks to my backend API that I created using express.

This is the user login page. Currently, there is no user authentification system set and is currently in development. Once completed, I can focus on optimizing the rest of the website.

This is the navbar menu that pops from the right. It was created using React-Bootstrap. There will be further additions/changes made to this navbar.
