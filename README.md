# BookLists - Start Here!

BookLists | CRUD App (In Development)

BookLists is a web application developed using **React + Vite**, **Node.js** with **Express.js**, and a **MySQL** database. It allows users to create and discover book lists across different genres. The project showcases my proficiency in modern web development technologies and demonstrates my ability to build scalable applications.

**Key Technologies:**
* **React + Vite**: Leveraged the power of React and Vite to create a responsive user interface.
* **Node.js + Express.js**: Built a robust backend API for seamless communication between the frontend and backend.
* **MySQL**: Ensured secure and efficient storage of book data.
* **MaterialUI**: Enhanced the visual appeal and usability of the application.
* **Google Books API**: Integrated to fetch comprehensive book information, expanding the range of available books.
* **Axios**: Handled HTTP requests for smooth communication between the frontend and backend.
* **React Router Dom**: Enabled smooth navigation within the application.
* **Bootstrap**: Improved responsiveness and device compatibility.

I am currently working on adding user authentication and polishing the frontend design. Once completed, the application will be deployed to Google's Firebase cloud server for scalability.
